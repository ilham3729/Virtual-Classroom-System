The Virtual Classroom project is a desktop application designed to address the growing need for efficient and user-friendly tools in online education. With the shift toward virtual learning environments, the demand for platforms that streamline communication, content delivery, and assessment has increased significantly. 
However, existing solutions are often cloud-dependent, require extensive setup, or lack the flexibility needed for smaller institutions and individual educators. This project aims to fill that gap by providing a standalone, intuitive application for course management and collaboration. 
The Virtual Classroom empowers instructors and students with role-specific functionalities. Instructors can create and manage courses, upload educational materials, and evaluate student assignments, while students can enroll in courses, access uploaded resources, and submit assignments for grading. The application is developed using Java Swing, offering a visually appealing dark-themed interface that enhances readability and usability. 
Designed with simplicity and functionality in mind, the Virtual Classroom integrates core features such as user registration and authentication, course creation, file uploads, and assignment management. Its modular architecture ensures scalability and maintainability, making it a robust solution for educational needs. By leveraging local execution, the application also ensures user data privacy and reduces dependency on internet connectivity, making it ideal for diverse use cases. 
This report provides a detailed overview of the Virtual Classroom project, highlighting its motivation, methodology, implementation, and key achievements. The project not only meets the requirements of an effective virtual learning platform but also sets the foundation for future enhancements to support a broader range of educational activities.
